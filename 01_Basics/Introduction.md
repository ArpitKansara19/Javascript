> **Use Cases:**
- Form Validation
- DOM Manipulation
- Asynchronous Programming
- Server-side Development (Node.js)

JavaScript is essential for modern web development due to its flexibility and capabilities.

### 🔑 **Key Features:**
- 🏗️ **Dynamic Web Pages:** Manipulate HTML/CSS in real-time.
- 🏃‍♂️ **Event Handling:** React to user actions.
- 🛂 **Form Validation:** Enforce input criteria.
- 🛠️ **Web Applications:** Power frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.
- 🌍 **Backend Development:** Node.js for server-side programming.

## 🏷️ **What is ECMAScript?**
ECMAScript (ES) is the standard on which JavaScript is based. It defines how the language should work to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

### 📌 **Key ECMAScript Versions:**

| **Version** | **Year** | **Features**                                   |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| **ES5**     | 2009    | Strict mode, JSON support                     |
| **ES6**     | 2015    | `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals |
| **ES7+**    | 2016+   | Async/await              |

## 🏗️ **Difference Between JavaScript and ECMAScript**

| **Feature**          | **JavaScript**                             | **ECMAScript**                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Programming language used in web dev.     | Language specification (standard)           
| **Implementation**    | Based on ECMAScript standard.             | Defines how JS should behave.               
| **Updates**           | Uses ES versions for improvements.        | Provides rules for versions (ES5, ES6).

## 🏷️ **Hello World Example:**

```javascript
// This is a basic JavaScript program
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

---

## 🛑 **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use `let` and `const` instead of `var`.
- ✅ Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase).
- ✅ Comment your code for better readability.

---

✅ **In Summary:**
- **JavaScript** is the language developers write.
- **ECMAScript** is the standard that defines how JavaScript should behave.
